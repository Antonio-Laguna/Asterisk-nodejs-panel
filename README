JavaScript Operator Panel [JOP]
================================

As opposed to FOP [http://www.asternic.org / http://www.fop2.com/], JOP is meant to be a HTML/JS solution to see the current Asterisk status in a Pannel.

It's built on top of node.js, socket.io and express.js

*Note*: As our Asterisk build and dialplan are heavily customized, we are using curls from dialplan and routes through express to perform actions but you could connect to the AMI and be able to capture events. If you are interested, you could use some other Node - Asterisk modules
